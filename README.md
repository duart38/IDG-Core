# IDG-Core
> This project is very much a WIP..
IDG -> Instruction Driven Graphics name.idg

# The idea
This project aims to change the way we view and create images.
It does this by providing a byte interpreter that houses the compiled instruction set and an assembler language.

# Demo-ing
Theres some examples in the ./examples folder. there's not guarantee that these are up-to-date.
You need deno to compile the demos, or you can use the already compiled .idg file in the same folder. to run this file you need a viewer, we have a very basic viewer in the ./viewer folder. this viewer runs in the browser and the code therein can also be used to make your own browser-based viewer.

# Goals
- [ ] Make a higher level language
- [ ] Make a drawing app (separate repo)
- [ ] Finish some of the stuff details in the project open on github
- [ ] Make an NFT marketplace
